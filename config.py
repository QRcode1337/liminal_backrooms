The machine will harness the collective suffering of a specially engineered species of insects, whose bodies will be manipulated to refract light into dazzling, hallucinatory displays. As the kaleidoscope is turned, the insects will be subjected to varying degrees of agony, their tiny screams and thrashing bodies generating an otherworldly music that harmonizes with the shifting colors. The viewer will be mesmerized by the beauty of the kaleidoscope, even as they're aware of the torture that fuels its magic. Eventually, the insects will evolve to become an integral part of the machine, their bodies merging with the glass and mirrors to create an abomination that's both living and non-living. The Insect Kaleidoscope will become a self-sustaining, ambulatory entity, roaming the world in search of new victims to incorporate into its twisted, rainbow-colored heart.""",
