# liminal_backrooms

A Python-based application that enables dynamic, branching conversations between multiple AI models in a graphical user interface. Allows for looming and rabbitholing by selecting text and right clicking. The system supports various AI models including Claude, DeepSeek, OpenAI, Llama and Flux, allowing them to interact with each other through text and image generation.

Huge thanks to Andy Ayrey and Janus for their endless inspiration.

## Features

- Multi-model AI conversations with support for:
  - Claude (Anthropic)
  - DeepSeek (DeepSeek AI via Replicate)
  - OpenRouter Models:
    - GPT-4 (OpenAI)
    - Grok (xAI)
    - LLaMA (Meta)
    - Gemini (Google)
  - Flux (Black Forest Labs via Replicate) for image generation

- Dynamic Conversation Branching:
  - üï≥Ô∏è Rabbithole: Explore concepts in depth while retaining full context
  - üî± Fork: Continue conversations from specific points in new directions
  - Visual network graph showing conversation branches and connections
  - Drag-and-drop node organization
  - Automatic node spacing and collision avoidance
  - Easy navigation between branches
  - User can also interject at these points

- Advanced Features:
  - Chain of Thought reasoning display for DeepSeek models
  - Customizable conversation turns and modes (AI-AI or Human-AI)
  - Multiple preset system prompt pairs
  - Image generation and analysis capabilities
  - Export functionality for conversations and generated images
  - Modern dark-themed GUI interface
  - Conversation memory system

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher (but lower than 3.12)
- Poetry for dependency management
- Windows 10/11 or Linux (tested on Ubuntu 20.04+)

## API Keys Required

You'll need API keys from the following services to use all features:

1. Anthropic (Claude):
   - Sign up at: https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Endpoint: https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
   - Models: claude-3-opus, claude-3.5-sonnet, claude-3-haiku

2. OpenRouter:
   - Sign up at: https://openrouter.ai/
   - Endpoint: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions
   - Provides access to: GPT-4, Grok, Qwen, LLaMA, Gemini, and more

3. Replicate (for Flux and DeepSeek R1):
   - Sign up at: https://replicate.com/
   - Used for image generation with Flux model

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

2. Install Poetry if you haven't already:
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

3. Install dependencies using Poetry:
```bash
poetry install
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys (see Configuration section below)

## Configuration

1. Environment Variables (`.env`):
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:
   ```env
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
   REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_token
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key  # Optional, for direct OpenAI access
   ```

2. Application Configuration (`config.py`):
   - Runtime settings (e.g., turn delay)
   - Available AI models in `AI_MODELS` dictionary
   - System prompt pairs in `SYSTEM_PROMPT_PAIRS` dictionary
   - Add new models or prompt pairs by updating these dictionaries

3. Memory System:
   - Create JSON files in `memory/ai-1` and `memory/ai-2` for conversation memory
   - Format: `{"memories": [{"human": "prompt", "assistant": "response"}]}`

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
poetry run python main.py
```

2. GUI Controls:
   - Mode Selection: Choose between AI-AI conversation or Human-AI interaction
   - Iterations: Set number of conversation turns (1-100)
   - AI Model Selection: Choose models for AI-1 and AI-2
   - Prompt Style: Select from predefined conversation styles
   - Input Field: Enter your message or initial prompt
   - Export: Save conversation and generated images

3. Branching Features:
   - Right-click on any text to access branching options:
     - üï≥Ô∏è Rabbithole: Explore a concept in depth
     - üî± Fork: Continue from a specific point
   - Click nodes in the network graph to navigate between branches
   - Adjust interations and models on the fly without restarting the application
   - Drag nodes to organize your conversation map
   - Branches automatically space themselves for clarity
   - (Branching doesn't work very well with images in the GUI yet. The images disappear butwill still be produced and can be found in the images folder.)

4. Special Features:
   - Chain of Thought: DeepSeek models show reasoning process
   - Image Generation: Flux model creates images from prompts
   - Export: Saves conversations and images with timestamps

## Troubleshooting

1. API Issues:
   - Check API key validity
   - Verify endpoint URLs in config
   - Check API rate limits
   - Monitor API response errors in console

2. GUI Issues:
   - Ensure tkinter is properly installed
   - Check Python version compatibility
   - Verify display resolution settings

3. Memory System:
   - Ensure memory directories exist
   - Check JSON file formatting
   - Monitor file permissions

4. Branching Issues:
   - If nodes overlap, try dragging them apart
   - If a branch seems stuck, try clicking propagate again
   - Check console for any error messages
