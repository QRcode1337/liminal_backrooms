# liminal_backrooms

A Python-based application that enables dynamic, branching conversations between multiple AI models in a graphical user interface. Allows for forking and rabbitholing by selecting text and right clicking. The system supports various AI models including Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Grok etc, allowing them to interact with each other through text and image generation.

Huge thanks to Andy Ayrey and Janus for their endless inspiration.

   - Endpoint: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions
   - Provides access to: GPT-4, Grok, Qwen, LLaMA, Gemini, and more

3. Replicate (for DeepSeek R1; optional):
   - Sign up at: https://replicate.com/
   - Used for DeepSeek R1 text generation; Flux image generation optional

4. OpenAI Images (required for auto-image generation):
   - Requires OPENAI_API_KEY for the gpt-image-1 model

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

2. Install Poetry if you haven't already:
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

3. Install dependencies using Poetry:
```bash
poetry install
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys (see Configuration section below)

## Configuration

1. Environment Variables (`.env`):
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:
   ```env
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
   REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_token (not required)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key  # For image generation (gpt-image-1)
   ```

2. Application Configuration (`config.py`):
   - Runtime settings (e.g., turn delay)
   - Available AI models in `AI_MODELS` dictionary
   - System prompt pairs in `SYSTEM_PROMPT_PAIRS` dictionary
   - Add new models or prompt pairs by updating these dictionaries

3. Memory System (optional):
   - Place JSON files at `memories/ai-1_memories.json` and `memories/ai-2_memories.json`
   - Contents should be a JSON array of prior messages (simple strings are fine)

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
poetry run python main.py
```

2. GUI Controls:
   - Mode Selection: Choose between AI-AI conversation or Human-AI interaction
   - Iterations: Set number of conversation turns (1-100)
   - AI Model Selection: Choose models for AI-1 and AI-2
   - Prompt Style: Select from predefined conversation styles
   - Input Field: Enter your message or initial prompt
   - Export: Save conversation and generated images in multiple formats
   - Statistics Panel: View real-time session metrics (turns, messages, branches, time)
   - Menu Bar: Access all features through organized menus (File, Edit, View, Navigation, Help)

3. Branching Features:
   - Right-click on any text to access branching options:
     - üï≥Ô∏è Rabbithole: Explore a concept in depth
     - üî± Fork: Continue from a specific point
   - Click nodes in the network graph to navigate between branches
   - Adjust iterations and models on the fly without restarting the application
   - Drag nodes to organize your conversation map
   - Branches automatically space themselves for clarity
   - (Branching doesn't work very well with images in the GUI yet. The images disappear but will still be produced and can be found in the images folder.)

4. Special Features:
   - Chain of Thought: DeepSeek models show reasoning process
   - Image Generation: OpenAI Images (gpt-image-1) creates images from prompts
   - Drag & Drop: Drop image files directly onto the conversation window
   - Export: Saves conversations in HTML, Markdown, or JSON formats with timestamps
   - Search: Find text within conversations (Ctrl+F)
   - Bookmarks: Mark and quickly navigate to important conversation nodes (Ctrl+B)
   - Auto-save: Conversations automatically saved every 5 minutes to exports/autosave/
   - Theme Toggle: Switch between dark and light themes (Ctrl+T)
   - Zoom Controls: Zoom in/out on network graph (Ctrl++/Ctrl+-)
   - Undo/Redo: Reverse conversation actions (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y)

5. Keyboard Shortcuts:
   **File Operations:**
   - Ctrl+S: Save conversation
   - Ctrl+E: Export conversation
   - Ctrl+L: Clear conversation
   - Ctrl+Q: Exit application

   **Edit Operations:**
   - Ctrl+Z: Undo
   - Ctrl+Y: Redo
   - Ctrl+F: Search in conversation
   - Ctrl+C: Copy selected text

   **View Operations:**
   - Ctrl++: Zoom in network graph
   - Ctrl+-: Zoom out network graph
   - Ctrl+0: Reset zoom
   - Ctrl+T: Toggle dark/light theme

   **Navigation:**
   - Ctrl+B: Bookmark current node
   - Ctrl+Shift+B: Show bookmarks

## Troubleshooting

1. API Issues:
   - Check API key validity
   - Verify endpoint URLs in config
   - Check API rate limits
   - Monitor API response errors in console

2. GUI Issues:
   - Ensure PyQt6 is installed (handled by Poetry install)
   - Check Python version compatibility
   - Verify display resolution settings

3. Memory System:
   - Ensure memory files exist in `memories/`
   - Check JSON formatting
   - Monitor file permissions

4. Branching Issues:
   - If nodes overlap, try dragging them apart
   - If a branch seems stuck, try clicking propagate again
   - Check console for any error messages
